## The reason why

The [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/2022) is a great event to code for fun, not only for work. We took up the
challenge and share the solved tasks in Python for the 2022 edition.

## Get started

Install dependencies with \`poetry install\`, run \`pytest year2022\` and X-mass is coming! Ho! Ho! Ho! :santa:
